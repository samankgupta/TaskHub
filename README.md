A user can create seperate lists for their personal tasks. Some examples of lists include "To Do", "In Progress" and "Complete".
A user can add, delete, edit lists. In each list, users can add, delete, edit cards. They can also drag and drop lists, cards to sort them as per their choice.

## Organisation Tasks

When a user signs in, they are added to an organisation. Users can use this to manage tasks for a company, organisation, etc.
The lists and cards work in the same manner as personal tasks.
